# ðŸ”– hi-lite

A web app designed to help bring more awareness to the best parts of your day. It works by collecting a quick text blurb about each highlight throughout your day, and at the end of the day, prompting you to select your favorite one. Then, at the end of every week, hi-lite will prompt you to select the highlight of your week from that week's daily highlights. Rinse and repeat for the month (from weekly highlights) and year (from monthly highlights). hi-lite will then store these memories in the highlights section, where you can drill down into each individual period of time to remember highlights!
